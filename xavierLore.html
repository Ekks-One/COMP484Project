                My first game ever was Minecraft on the Xbox 360. I was around 6 years old

                I remember being so amazed by the Minecraft and the endless possibilities it offered. 
                I would spend hours exploring, building, and creating in that blocky world. 
                It was a magical experience that sparked my love for gaming and creativity.

                I wanted to include this picture because it reminds me of the first house I built in Minecraft.
