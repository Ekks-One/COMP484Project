                Humble Beginnings
            </h2>
            <p class=paragraph>
                My first game ever was Minecraft on the Xbox 360. I was around 6 years old 
            </p>

            <p class=paragraph>
                I remember being so amazed by the Minecraft and the endless possibilities it offered. 
                I would spend hours exploring, building, and creating in that blocky world. 
                It was a magical experience that sparked my love for gaming and creativity.

            <h2>My First House</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Even though this isn't my actual first house <br>
                I wanted to include this picture because it reminds me of the first house I built in Minecraft.
            </p>
            <h2>Growing Up</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As I grew older, my love for Minecraft only deepened. I started to play Java Edition on the PC
                <br>
                I started to join popular servers and play with people I met, ones I talk to this day.

             <p class="paragraph">
                I also started to get into Minecraft PvP, which is a competitive aspect of the game where players fight against each other using various weapons and strategies. 
                I found it thrilling and challenging, and it added a whole new dimension to my Minecraft experience.
